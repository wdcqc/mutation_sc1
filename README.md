### Map Details

**Mutation_Melee** is a 3v3 melee map with Mutations which randomly adds different elements to the gameplay.

**Mutation_Autocom** adds computer AIs automatically for empty player slots so players can challenge EUD AIs.

**AI_Observation** makes the player an observer who watches AIs play against each other.

**AI_Observation_Type2** allows player to use the observer slot rather than normal player slot, which can zoom out and view data.

To use this map go to multiplayer and jump to observer slot, leaving the player slot empty.
